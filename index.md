* Lab 4

  Lab 4, part 2 was a favortie because it was game, the Hi-Lo Guessing Game. I found it very interesting since I enjoy games. Although it is a guessing game and the players and continuously, the code created has a purpose for that. In doing so, I learned a greater understanding of if and else statements.


* Lab 6

  Lab 6, part 1 was another favorite because we were able to make a sandwich. Instead of rewriting an item to include it, we used command_line statement and assigned an index to the elements. The statement std::string was very helpful to bring all the ingriedients together.


* Lab 7

  Lab 7 was a favorite because the situation was interesting. It made me realize all the details of the street rules needed to be included. It important to have the little details of the steet rules even if it means when a person can and cannot park. Minor errors in coding can lead to an unsuccessful program.
