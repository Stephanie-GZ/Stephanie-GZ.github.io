* Lab 4

  Lab 4, part 2 was my first favortie because it was a game, the Hi-Lo Guessing Game. I found it very interesting since I enjoy games. Although it's a guessing game and the players can continuously guess incorrectly, the code created has a purpose for that. In doing so, I learned a greater understanding of if and else statements.


* Lab 6

  Lab 6, part 1 was my second favorite because we were able to make a sandwich. Instead of rewriting an item to include it, we used the command_line statement and assigned an index to the elements. The statement std::string was very helpful to bring all the ingredients together.


* Lab 7

  Lab 7 was my third favorite because the situation was interesting. It made me realize all the details of the street rules needed to be included. It's important to have the little details of the steet rules even if it means a specific time a person can and cannot park. Minor errors in coding can lead to an unsuccessful program.
